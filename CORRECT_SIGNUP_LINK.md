# ✅ Correct Link for Market Data API

## 🎯 For Stock Market Data: IEX Cloud

**NOT SerpAPI** - That's for web scraping/search results.

### ✅ Correct Link:
**https://iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register**

Or go to: **https://iexcloud.io** and click "Sign Up"

## 📋 What to Do:

1. Go to: **https://iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register**
2. Sign up (free, no credit card)
3. After signup, go to Dashboard
4. Find **"Publishable Token"** (starts with `pk_...`)
5. Copy the entire token

## ❌ Wrong Service:

- ❌ SerpAPI (https://serpapi.com) - This is for web scraping/search
